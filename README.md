- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Challenges and Lessons 

This was my first javascript heavy challenge in a while. During my studies I have learned the basic of javascript however the lessons were a tad dated. During this challenge I was able to use alot of modern js. For example I typically relied on for loops and functions (function(){}) to accomplish everything. In this projects I used arrow functions, the many array related functionalities and also learned more about event listeners. Sources consulted can be fonud in the comments of the js.
